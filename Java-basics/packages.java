/* Package is like a folder as we create for movies, songs, books etc
  In simple words, packages in Java are nothing but a folder that contains related files.

  Packages in Java can be categorised into 2 categories.
   1. Built-in / predefined packages:- java.lang, java.io, java.util etc
   2. User-defined packages:- Inside  package we can have java files like classes, interfaces and a sub package

 We cn't create two classes with same name but if we create two pckages we can create those in two different packages.
